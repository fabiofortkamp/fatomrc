# fatomrc

This is my configuration for the [Atom editor](https://atom.io).

My main use cases are:

* Working with Python scripts
* Writing in LaTeX
* Writing notes in Markdown

Please note that I'm still learning how to hack Atom and this project is not well organized.

This configuration has only been tested on macOS Mojave.
