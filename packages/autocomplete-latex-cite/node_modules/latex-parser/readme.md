This is a library designed to build abstract syntax trees for LaTeX documents using JavaScript / TypeScript.

## âš  Warning
This project only parses a subset of what can be considered "canonical" LaTeX. As I see it, a full LaTeX parser would be a complete port of the TeX code, and [I am not crazy enough to attempt that](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3814911/673206). Of course, we can still make something that works *most* of the time. This approach is similar to [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX), a Javascript library which focuses on math typesetting. This library focuses more on parsing text mode.

If you don't believe parsing LaTeX is necessarily difficult, prepare to be outsmugged:

## Usage
Download the [latest standalone JavaScript file (ES5)](https://github.com/digitalheir/latex-parser/releases/latest) or [install from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latex-parser): 
```sh
npm install latex-parser
```

```js
import {latexParser} from "latex-parser";

// tokens :: LaTeX[]
const tokens = latexParser.parse("hello \\author[opt]{name}");
```

## History on project
This project used to be a TypeScript fork of the [TeXnous project](http://texnous.org), but after v0.3.0 is modeled after the Haskell LaTeX library [HaTeX](https://github.com/Daniel-Diaz/HaTeX).
